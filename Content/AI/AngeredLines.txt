I don't have time for this, Seacrest out!
I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed today.
Well, I'm gonna be late for the meeting now, might as well walk.
Later, loser.
I'm sorry, no offense dude, but I don't have time for this.
Hey, look a kitty!
Why am I waiting here in line? Oh well, guess I'll leave.
I'm gonna have you fired!
You don't deserve this job.
Try paying more attention next time space cadet.
Sorry, I have to make that appointment to get my cat spayed.
Eh, I never liked that car anyways.
Well, I'm out, deuces!
